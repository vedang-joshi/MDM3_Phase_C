Desirability - who wants it and what context do they want it in?
Feasibility - when and where does it work best. And is it feasible for people to use? Is it a better fit in a particular context?
Viability - cost of making , are we able to make it cheaply? And will people buy it at this price? Are there similar products and do they sell for a lot/cost a lot to make


Describe the real world problem.
And more importantly how has this existing problem guided some of our decision making from an engineering point of view?

What are the next stages needed for prototyping to make this product commercial?
